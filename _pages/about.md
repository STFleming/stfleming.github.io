I am a researcher/educator interested in hardware-software codesign.
I love building custom digital hardware, compilers/passes for targetting that hardware and thinking about how to make it accessible through better programming models and abstractions.

I have experience in both academica (Imperial/Cambridge/Swansea) and industry (Microsoft Research/AMD Research) building:
* Frameworks that make it easier to interact with custom ML hardware in AMD devices [Riallto (GitHub)](https://github.com/AMDResearch/Riallto)
* Frameworks for allowing users to easier interact with custom hardware in FPGA devices [PYNQ (GitHub)](https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ)
* Courses for teaching embedded systems and custom hardware [EmSys (GitHub)](https://github.com/STFleming/EmSys)
* Distributed FPGA-based SmartNIC key-value store accelerators [Honeycomb (Paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14259)
* Multi-FPGA-based event-triggered high-performance computing systems [POETS (paper)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3580372)
* Compiler passes for generating protected circuits for Space Applications [StitchUP (paper)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2897937.2898097) [StitchUP (GitHub)](https://github.com/STFleming/StitchUp)
* Higher-order type systems for seamlessly linking hardware and software [PushPush (paper)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7092550)

I'm always happy to chat, so please reach out if you want to discuss things.
