I designed and ran the tutorial sessions for the Language Processors 2nd year Electronic and Information Systems undergraduate course.  Running these tutorial sessions involved developing tutorial problems on parsing and code generation, and helping students with the construction of their C ARM compilers using flex & bison. A lot of the problems set in the class revolved around the text-based computer game Zork.
